With a view to infuse fresh knowledge capital into the institutions, the scheme expects these Fellows/academicians to select specific resources of the institutions to use in their projects and take up research works that are related to the main objectives of these institutions. It is also expected that the research work would enrich the institution with a new creative edge and academic excellence.Nodal Institutions (Participating Institutions):The Scheme shall cover the institutions under the Ministry of Culture (MoC), as listed in the Guidelines, and may cover other such institutions in the future. The scheme will also cover Non-MoC institutions with cultural resources like manuscripts, artifacts, antiquities, books, publications, records, etc., and seek to take advantage of the scheme by engaging distinguished Fellows to work on its resources and also known for its rich publications.

However, the MoC has the discretionary power to relax these numbers.Administration of the Scheme:The total number of Fellowships administered by the institutions may be decided by the Ministry of Culture from time to time, in consultation with the participating institutions. This will be based on certain criteria such as the size of its untapped holdings, physical facilities already existing in the institution, the capacity of the institution to guide and inspire the Fellows to get the best out of them, its past record in publication and research, need for research/study in a particular area, etc. An amount of up to 2% of the total allocation may be set aside for meeting expenses related to the administration of the scheme including monitoring, implementation, inspection, review, etc. of the research work carried out by the Fellows, through outsourcing or Consultants. <|endoftext|>input: Tell me about Fellowship For Superannuated Faculty Membersoutput: The "Fellowship for Superannuated Faculty Members" scheme is a fellowship scheme by the University Grants Commission (UGC), Department of Higher Education to provide opportunities to superannuated faculty members of Universities/Institutes/Colleges, hereinafter “Institutions” to pursue research in their area(s).﻿<|endoftext|>input: Tell me about Indo-French Visiting/Mobility Programme for Women in Scienceoutput: The “Indo-French Visiting/Mobility Programme for Women in Science (PROWIS-II)” is dedicated to the young women scientists of both India and France.
