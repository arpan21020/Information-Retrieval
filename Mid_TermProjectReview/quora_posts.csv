Example- Shahrukh Khan In Swadesh Movie. Reasons for Brain Gain: - This has been primarily due to schemes such as Ramanujan Fellowship Scheme, Innovation in Science Pursuit for Inspired Research (INSPIRE) Faculty Scheme and the Ramalingaswami re-entry fellowship scheme. The launch of IPR Policy in 2016 has set a pace to resolve the IPR issues related to R&D in India. India is rapidly becoming a global design and developmental hub. Thousands of companies from around world have set up their R&D centres in India. Change in immigration rules of developed countries like UK & US could be one of the reasons of Indian origin scientist returning to India ",answer,1,3091,0,0,['https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-aa36822536b9bde8cd589e2a1b27a70a-pjlq'],[],168640941,MayurDhokchaule

Details: Visiting Advanced Joint Research (VAJRA) Faculty Scheme: This Scheme is to bring overseas scientists and academicians including Non-resident Indians (NRI) and Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) to India to work in public-funded Institutions and Universities for a specific period of time. The scheme offers adjunct/visiting faculty assignments to overseas scientists including Indian researchers to undertake high-quality collaborative research in cutting edge areas of science and technology with one or more Indian collaborators. Ramanujan Fellowship: This Fellowship provides attractive avenues and opportunities to Indian researchers of high calibre, who are residing abroad, to work in Indian Institutes/Universities in all areas of Science, Engineering and http://Medicine.It is directed to scientists and engineers below the age of 40 years, who want to return to India from abroad. Ramalingaswami Re-entry Fellowship: The programme is to encourage scientists (Indian Nationals) working outside the country, who would like to return to India to pursue their research interests in Life Sciences, Modern Biology, Biotechnology, and other related areas. Biomedical Research Career Programme (BRCP): This program provides an opportunity to early, intermediate and senior-level researchers to establish their research & academic career in Basic biomedical or Clinical & Public Health in India.These fellowships are open to all eligible researchers who wish to relocate or continue to work in India. Scientists/Technologists of Indian Origin (STIO) in Indian research Laboratory: There is a provision to appoint Scientists/Technologists of Indian Origin (STIO) on a contractual basis at Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) laboratories to nurture a research field in their area of expertise.

Along with learning the prescribed syllabus, students must enrich their biodata, which is the face a potential employer will look at. Even without seeing the person, an employer will be able to shortlist candidates. Thus, an average biodata should showcase extra skills and achievements acquired during the period of study. Students need to include details of publications, workshops and conferences attended and so on. In this context, fellowships and scholarships have great value and help prove that the candidate is skilled and meritorious. Even though both provide financial support, the former primarily focus on helping students with educational expenses, whereas fellowships encompass a broader range of purposes, including research, professional development, and advanced study at various stages. However, often these terms are used synonymously. Fellowships are typically merit-based and awarded to individuals who have demonstrated exceptional skills, expertise, or potential in their chosen area of study. They often come with various benefits, which may include financial stipends, tuition coverage, travel allowances, health insurance, access to specialised resources, and networking opportunities. Fellowships can be provided by various organisations, including universities, government agencies, non-profit foundations, and private institutions and may cover a range of fields, including academia, research, arts, sciences, humanities, healthcare, public policy, and more. They are provided either for higher education (post-graduate, doctoral and post-doctoral studies), or for short-term training programmes or to attend conferences. In India, agencies like University Grants Commission (UGC), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Indian Council For Cultural Relations (ICCR) and others provide fellowships for research and are popular among students. Apart from this, there are many national and international fellowships that help students pursue doctoral and post doctoral programmes and also provide assistance to training programmes. Fellowships play a pivotal role in research and academics, offering a range of benefits that contribute to the advancement of knowledge and the development of skilled professionals. Among the various benefits are: Financial support: This can be crucial for students and researchers to cover tuition fees, living expenses, and research-related costs. This financial stability allows individuals to focus on their work. Facilitates research opportunities: Fellowships provide opportunities to engage in focused, independent research or academic projects and to delve deep into the chosen field, contributing new knowledge and insights. This can lead to discoveries, solutions, and innovations that address pressing challenges and benefit communities at large. Encourages interdisciplinary collaboration: Many fellowships promote interdisciplinary work by bringing together individuals from diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise. This fosters a collaborative environment, enabling an exchange of ideas and approaches from different disciplines.

This provides guidance, advice, and a support system, as researchers navigate their academic and research journeys. Networking opportunities: The facilitation of interactions with fellow recipients, faculty members, and experts in the field can lead to collaborations, future research partnerships, and access to a broader academic community. Recognition: Being awarded a fellowship is a mark of recognition for a person’s academic achievements and potential. It can enhance one’s professional reputation and open doors to further opportunities. Many fellowship programmes are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion by providing opportunities to individuals from underrepresented backgrounds. This helps to create a more inclusive and equitable research and academic community. Overall, fellowships play a crucial role in nurturing talent, driving research excellence, and advancing knowledge across various academic disciplines. They contribute significantly to the growth and progress of both individuals and the broader academic and research community.
